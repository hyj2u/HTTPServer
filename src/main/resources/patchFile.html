                <h1>Original Patch</h1>
                <p>
                    The HTTP PATCH request method applies partial modifications to a resource.

                    The HTTP PUT method only allows complete replacement of a document. Unlike PUT, PATCH is not
                    idempotent, meaning successive identical patch requests may have different effects. However, it is
                    possible to issue PATCH requests in such a way as to be idempotent.

                    PATCH (like PUT) may have side-effects on other resources.

                    To find out whether a server supports PATCH, a server can advertise its support by adding it to the
                    list in the Allow or Access-Control-Allow-Methods (for CORS) response headers.

                    Another (implicit) indication that PATCH is allowed, is the presence of the Accept-Patch header,
                    which specifies the patch document formats accepted by the server.
