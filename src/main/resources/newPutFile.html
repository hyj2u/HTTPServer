                <h1>PUT</h1>
                <p>
                    The HTTP PUT request method creates a new resource or replaces a representation of the target
                    resource with the request payload.

                    The difference between PUT and POST is that PUT is idempotent: calling it once or several times
                    successively has the same effect (that is no side effect), where successive identical POST may have
                    additional effects, like passing an order several times.
